PornAOSP - Nougat
===========

Introduction
------------------

PornAOSP is a custom Android distribution based on LineageOS, focused on privacy while doing... emmmm... certain activities.


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/VolteROM/android.git -b paosp-n

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) for building instructions.


Buildbot
--------

All supported devices are built weekly and periodically as changes are committed to ensure the source trees remain buildable.

You can view the current build statuses at [LineageOS Jenkins](https://jenkins.lineageos.org/)

Builds produced weekly by the buildbot can be downloaded from [LineageOS downloads](https://download.lineageos.org/)
